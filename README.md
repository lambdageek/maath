## MathNet linear algebra in the browser

This is the synchronous version of the demo that freezes the foreground thread.

The multi-threaded version that offloads the computation to a background thread is [on the `threads` branch](https://github.com/lambdageek/maath/tree/threads)

## Build/run

Use `dotnet build` and `dotnet run` to build and serve the app.


After building the application, the result is in the `bin/$(Configuration)/net7.0/browser-wasm/AppBundle` directory.
