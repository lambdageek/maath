## MathNet linear algebra in the browser

This is the multi-threaded version of the demo that offloads the math computation to a background thread.

The single-threaded version runs the computation on the UI thread is [on the `main` branch](https://github.com/lambdageek/maath/tree/main)

## Build/run

Use `dotnet build` and `dotnet run` to build and serve the app.


After building the application, the result is in the `bin/$(Configuration)/net7.0/browser-wasm/AppBundle` directory.
